        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
         <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
           Tony Pepperoni's was established in 1967 by husband and wife Antonio 'Tony Pepperoni' 
           Romano and Mariana De Lucia-Romano, shortly after they imigrated to Manhattan from a 
           small vilage in the Italian countryside. They had four children, and following Tony's retirement 
           in 1993, his eldest son, Mateo Antonio 'Tony Perroni Jr.' Romano took over the business. 
           Today, the restaurant is managed by Tony Jr. alongside his sister, Gabriella Antonia "Toni" 
           Romano-Snachez. Together, the siblings have expanded the business and opened four 
           franchise restaurants across New York, with plans for morein progress. To this day, the 
           siblings still use their father's original recipes, and hold all their restaurants to the same high 
           standards of quality, service, and taste that their father established all those years ago.
